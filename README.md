This is an old article about C++ and Software Design. It talks about the differences between Engineering and Design.
The article complains about people treating coding as "engineering" when programmers have to iterate over and over again, similar to how designers work. Everything is part of the design process, and thus: coding is design. Coding is being pushed "earlier and earlier" (and if this article was published in 1992, how early is it now?).
It's just cool to see articles written about things I work with today that seem to be super modern, like coding and computers, associated with a time I think of as "old": the 20th century. This articles complains about some of the same issues we have today, as well. Waterfall design and rapid prototyping...
